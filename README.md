# Twitter Sentiment
This project is to be carried on for the final assignment of the course Python Programming for AI, given at the vocational college IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. The course is fully online and free.

In this project, the idea is to apply a machine learning algorithm on a set of pre-classified sentences in order to find a way of predicting the sentiment of future tweets.

The database used for training the algorithm is a dump from the social medium Twitter with the name training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv, retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ferno2/training1600000processednoemoticoncsv

This readme-file will be updated with each progress made in the project. So make sure you come back once in a week for new updates.
