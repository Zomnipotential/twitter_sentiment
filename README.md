# Twitter Sentiment
In this project, the idea is to apply a machine learning algorithm on a set of pre-classified sentences in order to find a way of predicting the sentiment of future tweets. The repository is saved and accessible as open project at https://github.com/Zomnipotential/twitter_sentiment

The database used for training the algorithm is a dump from the social medium Twitter with the name training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv, retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ferno2/training1600000processednoemoticoncsv

This readme-file will be updated with each progress made in the project. So make sure you come back once in a while for new updates.

RIGHT NOW, I AM WORKING ON COURSES IN STATISTICS AND PYTHON PROGRAMMING SO UPDATES ARE ON HOLE
